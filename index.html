									<h2><a href="https://github.com/BinodGurung-TheDataAnalyst/PortfolioProject/blob/main/SQLQuery%20Portfolio%20Project.sql">COVID Data Exploration in SQL<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>This project involves an exploratory data analysis of a vast COVID dataset in an unstructured manner. 
										The goal is to identify initial patterns, characteristics, and points of interest within the data. By 
										exploring the data in this way, we gain a better understanding of the dataset's contents and structure, making 
										it easier to navigate and use the data later on. Through this process, we may uncover important insights or
										 trends that can help inform decision-making and improve our understanding of the COVID pandemic.
										  Ultimately, the insights gained from this exploratory analysis can serve as a foundation 
										for more in-depth analyses and modeling in the future..</p>

									<p>In this project, we are utilizing a Tableau dashboard to present a comprehensive overview of global COVID data. 
										The dashboard provides insights into the average number of COVID cases and the percentage of the population that has been 
										infected with COVID for each country, as well as the total number of COVID-related deaths per continent. By using interactive 
										visualizations, users can easily explore and compare COVID data across different countries and continents. 
										This allows for a deeper understanding of the impact of COVID on a global 
										scale and can be a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in tracking the progression of the pandemic.. </p>

									<p>This project involves using the Python programming language to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of an individual. 
										BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person's height and weight, and is commonly used to assess health risks
										 associated with weight. By using Python to calculate BMI, we can create a simple and efficient tool that can
										  be used to evaluate an individual's health status. The program will take in a person's height and weight as input,
										   and use a standard formula to calculate their BMI. This information can then be displayed as output, along with a 
										   brief interpretation of the BMI score and any associated health risks. By using Python to automate this calculation, 
										we can create a tool that is accurate, efficient, and easily accessible to anyone with access to a computer or mobile device.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/BinodGurung-TheDataAnalyst/Portfolio-Project-Excel">Microsoft Excel BikeSales Dashboard<br />

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/BinodGurung-TheDataAnalyst/Portfolio-Project-Excel" class="image fit"><img src="images/bike.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project involves creating a dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze a bike sales dataset. 
										The dashboard will leverage the power of pivot tables to provide insights
										 into various aspects of the dataset, such as the average income per purchase, 
										 customer purchase by age range, and distance commute by customer. By visualizing
										  this data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner, the dashboard will enable users to explore
										   trends and patterns in the data, such as which age groups are making the most purchases, how far 
										   customers are willing to commute to purchase a bike, and how income levels impact buying behavior. Overall, this Excel dashboard will be a valuable tool for understanding and leveraging the bike
										 sales data to inform business decisions and drive growth.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/BinodGurung-TheDataAnalyst/PojectBI" class="image fit"><img src="images/survey.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project involves using Microsoft PowerBI to create an interactive dashboard of data collected from a professional survey. 
										The dashboard will highlight key insights such as the average salary, favorite programming language, and job satisfaction
										 level of survey respondents. By leveraging PowerBI's powerful data visualization and analysis tools, we can create an 
										 interactive and user-friendly dashboard that allows users to explore the survey results in-depth. For example,
										  users can filter and sort the data based on various criteria, such as years of experience or job title, to gain a better
										   understanding of how different factors impact survey results. Overall, this PowerBI dashboard will provide valuable insights into the opinions and experiences of professionals in the industry, 
										helping organizations make data-driven decisions and improve employee satisfaction.</p>
